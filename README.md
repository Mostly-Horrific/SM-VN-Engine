# Visual-Novel-Engine 
![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/Mostly-Horrific/Visual-Novel-Engine.svg?branch=master)

A super simple engine that allows for scripting of Japanese style visual novel games

## A bit of an introduction

This was started as a collaberation project at some point in 2012/2013 and some early progress was done on it, it was decided to revive this project from the dead and create something worthwhile

## Future of this repo

Active work is being done on this repo now, the engine is far from being complete
