# Visual-Novel-Engine
A vain attempt create an engine that would support visual novels

## A bit of an introduction

This was started as a collaberation project at some point in 2012/2013 and some early progress was done on it, it is really broken and as such is more of a reference point

## Future of this repo

I would love to get this working and achieve what we set out to do, might get a parser and get this engine responding to commands one day.
